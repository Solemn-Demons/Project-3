## Overview

The Storyboard App is a web application that allows users to create and organize plots, characters, and stories. Users can also create an account to save and access their work. The app is built using a MERN stack, which includes MongoDB as the database, Express.js for the server, React for the front-end, and Node.js as the runtime environment.

## Features

- **User Registration and Authentication:** Users can create accounts and log in to access their saved plots and characters.

- **Plot Management:** Users can create and manage plots for their stories. Each plot can have a title, description, and other relevant information.

- **Character Management:** Users can create and manage characters for their stories. Each character can have a name, description, and other attributes.
